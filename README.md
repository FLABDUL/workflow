# WorkFlowDemo

Welcome to the **WorkFlowDemo** repository! This repository demonstrates how to automate daily commits to GitHub using GitHub Actions. It's a fun and practical way to keep a GitHub repository active and showcase some basic automation using GitHub Actions.

## Description

This project automates the process of making commits to a GitHub repository daily (or as frequently as you set) by using a GitHub Actions workflow. The action runs on a schedule and performs the following tasks:
- Creates or updates a file (`commit_number.md`).
- Increases a commit counter each time the action runs.
- Commits the change and pushes it to GitHub.

## Features
- **Automated Daily Commits**: Runs on a schedule (you can adjust the frequency via cron).
- **Simple Commit Updates**: Keeps the repository updated with a simple counter or message.
- **GitHub Actions**: Demonstrates the power of GitHub Actions for automating tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. A GitHub account.
2. A repository to work with (you can create one).
3. Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub Actions.

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/WorkFlowDemo.git
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - If you're working in a virtual environment, activate it:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate  # For Unix-based systems
     .\.venv\Scriptsctivate   # For Windows
     ```

3. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - The workflow is automatically configured in `.github/workflows/daily_commit.yml`.
   - It is scheduled to run every day at midnight UTC. You can adjust the frequency by modifying the cron expression in the `.yml` file.

4. **Push Your Changes**
   - After making updates or changes to the repository, commit them and push them to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     git push
     ```

5. **Verify the Workflow**
   - Once the workflow is pushed, it will automatically run according to the schedule.
   - You can check the progress and results under the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
